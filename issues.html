        <td>I reserved yellow for buttons and link hover states, blue for helper elements (scrollbar, text field focus), and pink for the asterisks in the forms. I changed the shadow colour of one of the hero images from yellow to blue as yellow is now reserved for buttons. I also thought about using one colour per webpage, visually separating the various services the company offers (e.g. &quot;digital skills&quot; uses the pink accent colour, and &quot;work based learning&quot; uses yellow). both solutions are good, and a matter of personal taste</td>
